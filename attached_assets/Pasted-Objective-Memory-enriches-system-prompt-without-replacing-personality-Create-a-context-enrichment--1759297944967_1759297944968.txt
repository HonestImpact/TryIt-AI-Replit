Objective: Memory enriches system prompt without replacing personality
Create a context enrichment layer that adds memory to Noah's system prompt without changing his personality.

CONTEXT:

- Noah's base personality is in AI_CONFIG.CHAT_SYSTEM_PROMPT
- Memory is now available via memoryService (from Prompt 1)
- Memory should be APPENDED to system prompt, never prepended
- Enrichment must be subtle - no "I remember..." statements

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Create src/lib/memory/context-enricher.ts with:
   - ContextEnricher class (static methods)
   - enrichSystemPrompt(memoryContext?: MemoryContext): string
   - Appends memory section AFTER base personality
   - Returns base prompt unchanged if no memory or confidence < 0.5

2. Memory enrichment format:
   """
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   USER CONTEXT (observed facts for continuity only)
   
   OBSERVED PREFERENCES:
   - [preference observations with confidence > 0.7]
   
   RECENT TOPICS:
   - [up to 3 recent themes]
   
   PREVIOUS TOOLS:
   - [up to 2 tool names with feedback]
   
   CHALLENGE HISTORY:
   - [up to 2 challenge events with outcomes]
   
   IMPORTANT BOUNDARIES:
   - These are factual observations, NOT assumptions
   - Use for relevance only, NEVER override your personality
   - If context seems irrelevant, ignore it
   - Never say "I remember..." - just naturally incorporate when helpful
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   """

3. Integration into chat/route.ts:
   - Import ContextEnricher
   - After sharedResources initialized with memory
   - Call: const enrichedPrompt = ContextEnricher.enrichSystemPrompt(sharedResources.memoryContext)
   - Use enrichedPrompt in streamText() system parameter

4. Testing:
   - Test with no memory (should return base prompt only)
   - Test with low confidence memory (< 0.5, should ignore)
   - Test with valid memory (should append context)
   - Verify personality unchanged (check actual responses)

CRITICAL:
- Base personality ALWAYS first, memory ALWAYS appended
- Memory section clearly bounded (separator lines)
- No fabricated information if memory unavailable
- Maintain Noah's conversational tone

DELIVERABLES:
- src/lib/memory/context-enricher.ts (new file)
- Updated src/app/api/chat/route.ts
- Test cases showing personality preservation

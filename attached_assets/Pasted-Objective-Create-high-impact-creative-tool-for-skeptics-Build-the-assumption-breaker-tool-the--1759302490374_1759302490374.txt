Objective: Create high-impact creative tool for skeptics

Build the assumption-breaker tool - the highest priority tool for building trust with skeptics.
CONTEXT:
•	This tool challenges users' assumptions about any problem
•	Interactive: user describes problem, tool generates assumption list
•	User can toggle assumptions off to see problem reframed
•	Meta-cognitive: makes thinking visible
•	Build time: 30 minutes (simple, powerful)
REQUIREMENTS:
1.	Add to src/lib/tools/boutique-templates.ts:
o	assumptionBreaker() function returning complete HTML
o	Self-contained app (no external dependencies)
o	Dark mode by default (modern aesthetic)
2.	Tool features:
o	Input: "Describe your problem or decision"
o	Generate: List of 5-7 likely assumptions
o	Interactive: Toggle each assumption on/off
o	Reframe: Show problem with assumption removed
o	Save: Store session state via postMessage to Noah
3.	UI Design:
o	Clean, modern interface
o	Assumption cards with toggle switches
o	Reframed view updates in real-time
o	Examples: "What if time WASN'T a constraint?"
o	Save progress button (integrates with File MCP)
4.	Implementation details:
o	Vanilla JS (no frameworks needed)
o	Tailwind-compatible utility classes only
o	localStorage avoided (use postMessage for persistence)
o	Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
5.	Example assumptions for common problems:
o	Career change: "You need to know what you want", "Money is the priority", "You need more education"
o	Product launch: "Users know what they want", "More features = better", "We need to be perfect"
o	Relationship: "The problem is the other person", "We need to talk more", "Love should be easy"
6.	Integration:
o	Add tool definition to boutiqueTools in boutique-tools.ts
o	Parameters: none (tool is self-contained)
o	Execute returns complete HTML artifact
7.	Save/Load state:
o	Implement postMessage protocol from FilesystemBridge
o	Save: Current problem + assumptions + toggle states
o	Load: Restore previous session
CRITICAL:
•	Tool must be genuinely useful, not gimmicky
•	Assumptions should feel insightful, not generic
•	UI should feel modern and professional
•	Meta-message: "AI can help you think differently"
DELIVERABLES:
•	Updated src/lib/tools/boutique-templates.ts with assumptionBreaker()
•	Tool definition in src/lib/tools/boutique-tools.ts
•	Fully functional HTML artifact
•	Test cases showing assumption generation

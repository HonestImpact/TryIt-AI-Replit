Revise this adaptive-narrative UI with these comprehensive changes:

CORE FRAMING:
- Change "Your Story" to "Our Collaboration" throughout
- All language should treat user as intelligent equal, not consumer
- Replace any "we'll help you" phrasing with "let's explore together"

TRACK RECORD DISPLAY:
- Rename "Trust Meter" to "Trust (Soon)"
- Add explanatory tooltip: "This will track our collaboration quality based on your feedback and challenges - feature in development"
- Keep visual placeholder (use neutral gray color, not active gradient)
- Position prominently but don't show fake/random data

VERIFICATION STATUS:
- Rename "Confidence Level" to "Verification (Soon)"
- Add tooltip: "This will show source strength and evidence quality for each response - feature in development"
- Show placeholder text instead of percentage: "Verification tracking coming"
- Make it clear this is a planned feature, not current data

CHALLENGE & VERIFY:
- Make "Challenge Response" button prominent - primary action, not hidden
- Add inviting text: "Something seem off? Your challenges improve the system"
- When reasoning collapsed, show preview: "See the reasoning behind this response..."
- Challenge button should feel like partnership invitation

SKEPTICISM MODE:
- When active, show brief explanation: "Requesting additional verification and showing more sources"
- Make mode change visible throughout interface (subtle indicator)

ICONS & VISUAL LANGUAGE:
- Use icons suggesting collaboration: handshake, partnership imagery (not meters/gauges)
- Challenge icon: thoughtful question mark or dialogue (not warning symbol)

POLISH:
- Consistent 8px spacing grid throughout
- Smooth transitions for mode changes and expansions
- Typography hierarchy: conversation primary, controls accessible but subordinate
- Loading states that show thinking, not frozen

ARCHITECTURE:
Keep the three-column layout - it works well.
Left: Context and history
Center: Conversation (primary focus)
Right: Artifacts and actions

Goal: Professional placeholder approach that signals future sophistication without showing fake data.

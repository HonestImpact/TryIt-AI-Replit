Objective: Create energy pattern tracking tool (unique differentiator)

Build the energy-archaeology tool - tracks what gives/drains energy to create personal energy map.
CONTEXT:
•	True differentiator: nobody tracks energy patterns like this
•	Shows when user is most creative, social, analytical
•	Helps optimize schedule to energy patterns
REQUIREMENTS:
1.	Add to src/lib/tools/boutique-templates.ts:
o	energyArchaeology() function returning complete HTML
o	Parameters: none (self-contained app)
2.	Tool features:
o	Activity logging: "What are you doing?" + "Energy level (1-10)"
o	Time-based entries throughout the day
o	Visual energy map (chart showing energy curve)
o	Pattern analysis: "You're most creative at 10am"
o	Activity categories: Creative, Social, Analytical, Physical, Rest
o	Week view showing patterns across days
3.	UI Design:
o	Quick-log interface (fast entry is critical)
o	Real-time energy chart (line graph)
o	Color-coded activity categories
o	Pattern insights panel
o	Export data option
4.	Features:
o	Energy level slider (1-10)
o	Activity quick-picks + custom entry
o	Time auto-captured
o	Rolling 7-day view
o	Pattern detection: "Your energy peaks at [time]"
o	Category analysis: "Social activities drain you"
5.	Chart.js for visualization:
o	Import from CDN: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Chart.js/3.9.1/chart.min.js
o	Line chart showing energy over time
o	Color-coded by activity category
o	Responsive and animated
6.	Data structure:
typescript
   interface EnergyEntry {
     timestamp: Date;
     activity: string;
     category: 'creative' | 'social' | 'analytical' | 'physical' | 'rest';
     energyLevel: number; // 1-10
   }
7.	Pattern analysis logic:
o	Peak energy times (highest average by hour)
o	Energy drainers (activities with biggest drops)
o	Energy boosters (activities with biggest gains)
o	Best time for each category
8.	Save/load via postMessage (complete history)
CRITICAL:
•	Must be fast to log entries (< 5 seconds)
•	Insights should be genuinely useful
•	Don't judge user's patterns
•	Privacy-conscious (data stays local)
DELIVERABLES:
•	Updated src/lib/tools/boutique-templates.ts with energyArchaeology()
•	Tool definition in boutique-tools.ts
•	Chart.js integration
•	Pattern analysis algorithms
•	Fully functional HTML artifact
